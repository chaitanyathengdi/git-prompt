# git-prompt

Git Prompt: a function for adding nominal git info to the Linux Bash command prompt.

** Currently includes **

- Indicators of whether or not you have files that are untracked, modified, or added to the index.
- Indicator for whether or not your branch is in sync with origin(only supports one origin for now)
- The current branch and refname for HEAD

** Usage **

Copy/paste the code in the file at the end of your .bashrc file. The extra info shows for all git repositories.


** Acknowledgements **
